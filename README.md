# Game-of-Life-Py
Made this for a level 3 NCEA standard. I wouldn't recommend using this for anything other than getting a good grade because this got me an excellence, with the documentation, and testing. It's not great, still things I'd optimize with it, I wouldn't recommend making the game of life like this but lol
